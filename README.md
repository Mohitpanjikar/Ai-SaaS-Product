# Cloudinary AI-powered SaaS

This project is an AI-powered SaaS platform built using **Next.js**, **Cloudinary**, **Prisma**, **NeonDB**, and **DaisyUI**. It leverages Cloudinary's AI capabilities for image transformations and manipulations, providing seamless integration for handling media assets. The project is designed for modern user interfaces with a responsive and clean layout using DaisyUI.

## Features

- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-side rendering (SSR) and static web applications.
- **Cloudinary**: AI-powered media transformations and delivery.
- **Prisma**: ORM for easy database integration.
- **NeonDB**: Serverless Postgres database for high-performance data handling.
- **DaisyUI**: Utility-first CSS framework for clean and responsive UI.

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"

Ensure that these values are accurate and secure.

Usage

After setting up the environment variables, the application will be able to:
	•	Upload and manage media files via Cloudinary.
	•	Store metadata and related information in NeonDB using Prisma.
	•	Provide AI-powered image transformations and optimizations.
	•	Deliver a smooth user experience with a clean interface built with DaisyUI.

Run the following command to start the development server:

npm run dev

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the app.

Database Setup
	1.	Initialize Prisma:

npx prisma init


	2.	Migrate the database schema:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init


	3.	Push Prisma schema to the database:

Example Upload Code:

import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

// Upload function
const uploadImage = async (filePath) => {
  return await cloudinary.uploader.upload(filePath, {
    transformation: [
      { width: 500, height: 500, crop: 'fill' },
      { overlay: 'text:arial_60:Watermark', gravity: 'south_east', x: 10, y: 10 },
    ],
  });
};
